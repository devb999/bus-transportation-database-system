# bus-transportation-database-system
Problem Definition:
A Bus Transport System in a city is planning to expand its bus pass booking process to the public using an online method. Passengers will also be able to check hours of operation as well as bus frequency on different routes online. Additionally, the management is also planning to gather the data to improve their operations like identifying and managing busy routes and performing employee management. This project aims to define, create, and maintain Database for this Bus Transportation System.    ![image](https://github.com/devb999/bus-transportation-database-system/assets/122685735/1260abc7-e642-4baf-a26e-31818e7e28e6)

Following major tasks were involved in this database design project:
1. Performing Requirement Analysis  - identifying entities, attributes, and relationships.
2. Designing Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram
3. Converting ER Diagram into MySQL Relational Tables
4. Feeding custum data into database using MySQL
5. Creating SQL queries

Database system was designed and created to help passengers to purchase bus passes online, find bus route details such as bus stops, arrival times and bus frequency, using complex and nested SQL queries (JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY) to generate reports and improve company operations by analyzing bus pass purchase behavior and revenue generation, while maintaining data integrity using database normalization.
